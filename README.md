## Key Features
BPL provides a streamlined interface for selecting and managing players, with key features that include:

- **Claim Free Credit**: A "Claim Free Credit" button gives users a certain amount of free credits, which can be used toward purchasing players.

- **View Available Players**: The "Available" button displays all players currently open for selection, alongside the amount required to purchase each player, making it easy for users to decide on their next acquisition.

- **Choose and Manage Players**: Users can click the "Choose Player" button to add players to their selected cart. When a player is chosen, the associated cost is deducted from the user's main balance. The "Selected" button then shows all selected players, allowing users to view their current lineup. Additionally, users can remove players from the cart, and the player's cost will be added back to the main balance, ensuring users can manage their credits effectively.

- **Responsive Design**: Built with mobile-first responsiveness, ensuring an optimized experience across all devices.

- **Dynamic Balance Management**: The app adjusts the user's balance in real-time as players are selected or removed.

- **Detailed Player Information**: Quick access to each player‚Äôs details, including availability and pricing, for a smooth decision-making process.
